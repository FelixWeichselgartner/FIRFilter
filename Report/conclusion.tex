\section{Conclusions}
The work can be considered concluded, since the filter is compliant to its specifications. To reduce the number of multiplications the symmetric version of the filter could be developed since symmetric coefficients are given. The filter precision could be improved by increasing the number of steps obtaining a behavior more similar to an ideal filter. If further precision is required floating point numbers could be exploited at the cost of making the circuit more sophisticated.
